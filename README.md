🚀 Interactive Developer Portfolio
    A high-performance, responsive portfolio built with a focus on Frontend Engineering and User Experience. Featuring a dual-mode personality toggle ("Developer" vs. "Problem Solver") and a custom-built interactive SVG avatar.


✨ Key Features
    Interactive SVG Avatar: A custom-coded character that tracks the user's cursor in real-time using trigonometric calculations (Math.atan2).

    Skill Orbit System: A dynamic JavaScript-driven animation that periodically "pops" tech stack bubbles around the avatar without overlapping the UI.
    
    Dual-Perspective Mode: A global state toggle that shifts the site's messaging between technical "Developer" details and high-level "Problem Solver" business outcomes.

    Glassmorphic Design: A modern UI utilizing Tailwind CSS for frosted-glass effects, sleek gradients, and high-readability typography.
    
    Bento Box Projects: A grid-based layout for projects that provides a quick visual hierarchy of enterprise-scale work.


🛠️ Tech Stack
    HTML5 / CSS3: Semantic structure and custom keyframe animations.
    
    Tailwind CSS: For rapid utility-first styling and responsive design.

    Vanilla JavaScript: Used for state management (mode toggling), DOM manipulation, and the interactive SVG logic.
    
    SVG Animation: Real-time coordinate tracking and parallax effects.


🧠 Technical Highlights
    1. The Interactive "Look" LogicThe avatar doesn't just move randomly; it calculates the angle of the user's mouse relative to the center of the face to create a "follow" effect. This angle is then applied as a transform to the SVG's pupils and the head group for a 3D parallax feel.

    2. State-Driven ContentUsing a single source of truth for the site "mode," the UI filters content dynamically:
        Developer Mode: Focuses on tech stacks (AWS, Magento, React).
        Solver Mode: Focuses on metrics (40% faster resolution, 35% conversion increase).
